\cvsection{Research Interests}

My research interests lie in the whole area of computer science
and its interdisciplinary disciplines,
especially theoretical computer science,
including but not limited to
\textit{quantum computation},
\textit{algorithms and data structures},
\textit{computational complexity},
\textit{optimization}, % combinatorial
\textit{microprocessor architecture},
\textit{machine learning}
and
\textit{mathematical finance}.
